		<tr><td>I am a software engineer at Amazon.com, where I work on DevOps of software encompassing the entirety of the Retail and Digital stacks to provide a reliable platform for Digital partners to create and sell subscriptions bundled with devices. Prior to that, I worked at Shanghai Haoyong Network Technology Co. Ltd., where I worked on the company's core platform for its suite of parallel ASIC-resistant single-chip blockchain applications. I studied Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I consulted on projects with a particular focus on security and smart contracts. In addition to my professional work, my intellectual interests lie in operating systems, particularly in the design and implementation of the memory management layer and performance tuning.</td></tr>

<ul>

	<li> <span style='font-size:11.0pt'><b>minOS</b></span>: kernel that can run on the i386 architecture. Features full interrupt handling facilities, device driver support, an extensible macro-based unit testing framework, and a full suite of memory management interfaces, including buddy-slab page frame allocators, dynamic kernel memory heaps, and kernel object cache allocators.</li>
	<li> <span style='font-size:11.0pt'><b>veriscan</b></span>: FreeBSD daemon that uses a loadable kernel module to securely cache and periodically scan kernel memory in order to detect and then subsequently patch DKOM and system kernel memory hooks. Demonstrated to work against rootkits employing phantom system call tables and even kernel object hooks.</li>
	<li> <span style='font-size:11.0pt'><b>churchOS</b></span>: HolyC-based operating system cloned off Terry A. Davis' TempleOS with the design goal of improved security and better kernel memory interfaces</li>
