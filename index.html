		<tr><td>I am a software engineer at Shanghai Haoyong Network Technology Co. Ltd., where I manage the company's core codebase for its suite of parallel ASIC-resistant single-chip blockchain applications. Prior, I studied Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I consulted on projects with a particular focus on security, smart contracts, and low-latency code. While my professional work revolves around designing, testing, and product release of financial application software, my academic specialties and interests lie in operating systems theory, particularly in the design and implementation of kernel memory management layers.</td></tr>

<ul>

	<li> <span style='font-size:11.0pt'><b>minOS</b></span>: kernel that can run on the i386 architecture. Features full interrupt handling facilities, device driver support, an extensible macro-based unit testing framework, and a full suite of memory management interfaces, including buddy-slab page frame allocators, dynamic kernel memory heaps, and kernel object cache allocators.</li>
	<li> <span style='font-size:11.0pt'><b>veriscan</b></span>: FreeBSD daemon that uses a loadable kernel module to securely cache and periodically scan kernel memory in order to detect and then subsequently patch DKOM and system kernel memory hooks. Demonstrated to work against rootkits employing phantom system call tables and even kernel object hooks.</li>
	<li> <span style='font-size:11.0pt'><b>churchOS</b></span>: HolyC-based operating system cloned off Terry A. Davis' TempleOS with the design goal of improved security and better kernel memory interfaces</li>
