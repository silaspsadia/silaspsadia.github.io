		<tr><td>I am a software engineer at Shanghai Haoyong Network Technology Co. Ltd., where I manage the company's core codebase for its suite of parallel ASIC-resistant single-chip blockchain applications. Prior, I studied Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I consulted on projects with a particular focus on security, smart contracts, and low-latency code. While my professional work revolves around designing, testing, and product release of financial application software, my academic specialties and interests lie in operating systems theory, particularly in the design and implementation of kernel memory management layers.</td></tr>
