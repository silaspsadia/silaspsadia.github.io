		<tr><td>I am a software engineer at Shanghai Haoyong Network Technology Co. Ltd., where I manage the company's core codebase for its suite of parallel ASIC-resistant single-chip blockchain applications. Prior, I studied Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I led various projects with a particular focus on security, smart contracts, and low-latency code. Concurrently, I established a consistent clientele in a diverse group of companies, where I consulted on software and product development. My main specialities are firmware, OS development, and performance-critial software.</td></tr>
